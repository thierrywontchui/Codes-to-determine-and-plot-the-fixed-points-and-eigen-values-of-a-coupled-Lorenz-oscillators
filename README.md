# Codes-to-determine-and-plot-the-fixed-points-and-eigen-values-of-a-coupled-Lorenz-oscillators

The file "fixed_points_coupled_lorenz.m" determines the fixed point solutions of the coupled Lorenz system when the interaction is done simultaneaously through both the -x and -z directions. The ouput "solutions" is a matrix of 9 rows * 6 columns. The columns represent the variable x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, respectively. each row represents a possible fixed point solutions of the coupled system.

The file "fixed_point_plt_symb_x1.m" determines and plots the values of all the x1 components of the fixed point solutions of the coupled system as a function the coupling strength. 

The file "fixed_point_plt_symb_y1.m" determines and plots the values of all the y1 components of the fixed point solutions of the coupled system as a function the coupling strength. 

The file "eigen_values_plt.m" determines and plots the maximum eigen values of the Jacobian matrix J of the coupled system as a function the coupling strength.
